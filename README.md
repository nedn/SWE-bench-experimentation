# SWE-bench-experimentation

This repo contains various experimentations around agentic coding evals.

## Simple instructions for running SWE-bench locally

This is based on the great work from Epoch AI team
(https://epoch.ai/blog/swebench-docker) that publish the images for swe bench
evals.

We go a step further in adding simple utilities + instructions for anyone to be
able to run SWE bench tests on their local machine.
